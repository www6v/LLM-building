The programme is specifically designed for graduates from diverse disciplines as well as legal professionals who already have some practical commercial and business experience and who want to enhance their knowledge and skills to assist them in advancing their career, whether that is a career change or assuming a more senior-level role in a business, organization, or commercial enterprise.
The first AI language models trace their roots to the earliest days of AI. The Eliza language model debuted in 1966 at MIT and is one of the earliest examples of an AI language model. All language models are first trained on a set of data, then make use of various techniques to infer relationships before ultimately generating new content based on the trained data. Language models are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications where a user inputs a query in natural language to generate a result.
An LLM is the evolution of the language model concept in AI that dramatically expands the data used for training and inference. In turn, it provides a massive increase in the capabilities of the AI model. While there isn't a universally accepted figure for how large the data set for training needs to be, an LLM typically has at least one billion or more parameters. Parameters are a machine learning term for the variables present in the model on which it was trained that can be used to infer new content.
In this method, the gradient of distance is used to split chunks along with the percentile method. This method is useful when chunks are highly correlated with each other or specific to a domain e.g. legal or medical. The idea is to apply anomaly detection on gradient array so that the distribution become wider and easy to identify boundaries in highly semantic data. Similar to the percentile method, the split can be adjusted by the keyword argument breakpoint_threshold_amount which expects a number between 0.0 and 100.0, the default value is 95.0.
